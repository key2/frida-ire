  Frida Web Frontend
----------------------

This package will become the Java-based frontend for Frida, capable of running
in a Java-enabled browser. But this belongs to the future.

It is presently a test bed for the code provided by in frida.core
and frida.plugin.*

The present code is not designed with any reasonable MVC in mind, nor is it
capable of connecting to remote Frida services via XMPP, like the other Frida
frontends.
